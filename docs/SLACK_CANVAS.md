# Zeon

this is pretty much just a guide for each one of zeons major features!

## Blind mail

[Learn how that works here](./docs/HOW_BLIND_MAIL_WORKS.md)

## Sticky Messages

Sticky messages are messages created and ment to stay at the bottom of the channel.
This means you can still actively use the channel while the message will stay at the bottom. <br />
here are the commands:

- _`/stickymessage create <message>`_ - create a sticky message! (make sure both zeon's are in the channel!! or its public)
  <br />example:

![example of the cmd](../assets/stickymessage/create_0.png)

and should look like this after the command is ran:

![example of output](../assets/stickymessage/create_1.png)

- _`/stickymessage edit <newmessage>`_ - Edit a sticky message
  <br />example:

![example of the cmd](../assets/stickymessage/edit_0.png)

and this is an example of what it should look like after it is ran:

![example of the output](../assets/stickymessage/edit_1.png)
<br />_prev sticky message is edit to reflect new message_

- _`/stickymessage delete`_ - delete a sticky message from the channel and wont send it no more
  <br />example:

![example of the cmd](../assets/stickymessage/delete_0.png)

and after it will send this message to the channel and delete the sticky message:
![example of the output](../assets/stickymessage/delete_1.png)

## Hackclub shipment viewer

Hackclub provides a shipment viewer for your shipments!
My system is a WIP as shipment viewer is always changing but it has the following features:

- Showing last 4 shipments in app home
- Sending u updates when a new shipment is added!
  To first set it up you need to run the following command: `//zeon-hackclub-shipments <your shipment url>`:
  ![example](../assets//shipmentviewer/setup_cmd.png)
  The url contains your **email** and **signature** so be careful not to send it into a public channel!

Once you have set it up you can check @Zeon's app home and after a couple minutes you should see something like this:

![app home](../assets/shipmentviewer/app_home.png)

Zeon will also watch to see if you get any new shipments, if u do get a new one or one is modified/updated he will send you a message in the channel!
<br /> messages will look something like this:

<!-- TODO: maybe fix this -->

there will be an img soonnn.

## Bday System

You can add your bday so zeon will wish you a happy bday!! (you also get a cool little site with it.)
to add your bday you need to execute the following command: `/bday config YYYY-MM-DD` (please note u may have to do +1 to the day since they are 0 index'ed)
Once you have done that on the day of your bday you will get a message in #zeon-bdays with a happy birthday message!

## d20 Dice System

## #hastebin

## High Seas LB Tracker

the high seas lb which is scraped of the web version can be found [here]() is used in the #high-seas-lb channel and the app home.
the bot displays the top 10 in the app home.
![example](../assets/highseaslb/app_home.png)

and then in the channel updates are send every 10 minutes with the changes in the lb as well! (see below for examples)

![channel message](../assets//highseaslb/channel_message.png)
![thread](../assets/highseaslb/thread.png)

## zeon tags

zeon has a tag like feature where u can create
the personal tags system has 3 main commands:

- `/tag add`
  this command will popup with a modal and you can add what content you want in the tag!
  ![modal popup](../assets/tags/modal_popup.png)

after you submit it, it will dm you a message saying the tag has been saved!.

- `/tag use <tag>`
  This will have zeon send the tag into that channel saying you sent it! Please make sure zeon is in the channel for this to work.
- `/tag rm <tag>`
  This will remove the tag from the db.
